## Features
The website is a single page site, the page is essentially split into 5 sections but the main part of the web page will be the game area.

### Header
The header only contains the logo, since its a single page website there is not a need for a nav bar to take the user to other pages. The logo has a link to the website as it would be expected by users to take them back to the home page.

### Introduction
The introduction section gives the user the sites purpose by presenting the user with a challenge by challenging the visitor to type quickly. If the user needs further explanation on how the challenge works, there is a link to the rules section which takes the user further down the page.

### Game-area
The game-area will be where users will spend most of the time on the site and where the javascript has been implemented. The game-area can be broken down into 3 more sections - the challenge, user input and time.

#### The Challenge
The user is presented with the instruction to type the challenge sentence below, the challenge is an array of sentences that have been taken from idioms.

<li>
These senetences are always randomised whenever the page is loaded or the game is replayed, they also always appear in a random order so the challenge is not predictedable for the user to not bore easily.
</li> 
<br>
<li>The user will also not be able to copy the challenge as the selection text selection has been disabled for this section.
</li>

#### User Input
The input area has been created as form for a user to be able to use the input box and submit their entry. The entry needs to match the challenge - this includes spelling, punctuations and capitilisation.

<li>
Once the entry is submitted, the users entry is validated against the challenge that appears above the input box. If the users entry does not match the challenge, a message will appear informing the user if the entry matches or not.
<br>
<li>
Auto-fill has been disabled so it does distract the user with suggestions and users cannot also cheat if they had already submitted a challenge they had already done.
</li>
<br>
<li>
The input box locks after the the challenge has been submitted for users to be unable to try and submit again
